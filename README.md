# calculator-project

calculator final project from the odin project foundations. used css html and javascript. took forever but i'm pretty happy with it, don't really know what more I would've wanted to do with it, maybe some more operations but that's a problem for future vicente if he chooses to accept it.

I think my main takeaway here is to make functions for **everything** and use them as needed, instead of trying to code things over and over again. that way when there's an issue, you just need to fix it once. Also in a similar vein its a lot easier to make a text like the input one string and split it up as needed instead of trying to combine three strings when you need the whole thing.
